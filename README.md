## analyse webpack(static module bundler)
Core packages:
webpack: The main bundler utility
webpack-cli: Provides a flexible set of commands for developers to increase speed when setting up a custom webpack project
webpack-dev-server: Provides a development server with hot-reloading capabilities

React packages:
react: Core package for building React applications
react-dom: React package for DOM rendering

Babel packages:
babel-loader: Allows transpiling JavaScript files using Babel and webpack
@babel/core: Core Babel package, necessary for Babel to work
@babel/preset-env: Allows you to use the latest JavaScript features
@babel/preset-react: Transpiles JSX to createElement calls

Linting:
eslint: The core ESLint library
eslint-webpack-plugin: Webpack plugin for ESLint
eslint-config-prettier: This package turns off all ESLint rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier. It makes the integration of Prettier and ESLint smoother. ESLint rules that would conflict with Prettier's formatting are disabled, so you can comfortably format code with Prettier without ESLint complaining about formatting issues that Prettier handles.
eslint-plugin-prettier: This package allows running Prettier as an ESLint rule and reporting differences as individual ESLint issues. It's used to enforce consistent Prettier formatting across your codebase. If you're using this plugin, your code will be formatted using Prettier when you save your file (assuming your editor is set up to do so), but if any Prettier formatting rules are not met, ESLint will highlight those issues.
eslint-plugin-react-hooks: This package provides ESLint rules for React Hooks. It enforces the Rules of Hooks â€“ the rules that must be followed when using Hooks in React. The two main rules it enforces are "Only Call Hooks at the Top Level" (ensures hooks are not called inside loops, conditions, or nested functions) and "Only Call Hooks from React Functions" (ensures hooks are only called inside React functional components or custom hooks).
